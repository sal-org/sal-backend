                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Therapist Inference:</p>
                <p>Your score indicates moderate anxiety. At this level of anxiety, you're likely to focus exclusively on the stressful
                    situation directly in front of you and ignore other tasks.</p>
                <p>Although moderate anxiety symptoms are disruptive, people with moderate anxiety may have success in
                    managing their anxiety with the help of a doctor or self-help strategies. Taking steps will help to prevent physical,
                    psychological and emotional issues. You can also work along with our SAL counsellors for guidance on areas
                    where there is scope of improvement.</p>
            </div><br/><hr><br/>
            <div>
                <h4>Scoring</h4>
                <p>The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of “not at all,”
                    “several days,” “more than half the days,” and “nearly every day,” respectively, and then adding together the
                    scores for the seven questions. Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over
                    the past two weeks. GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. A score of 8 or greater represents
                    a reasonable cut-point for identifying probable cases of generalized anxiety disorder; further diagnostic
                    assessment is warranted to determine the presence and type of anxiety disorder.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Tips to control or lessen your Anxiety:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn about your disorder.</span>The more you know, the better prepared you will be to manage symptoms and
                        roadblocks along the way. Don’t be afraid to ask your therapist any questions you might have. Remember,
                        you are a key part of your health care team.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stick to your treatment plan.</span>Suddenly stopping your meds can cause unpleasant side effects and can even
                        trigger anxiety symptoms.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cut down on foods and drinks that have caffeine,</span>such as coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks,
                            and chocolate. Caffeine is a mood-altering drug, and it may make symptoms of anxiety disorders worse.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don’t use alcohol and recreational street drugs.</span>Substance abuse increases your risk of anxiety disorders.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eat right and exercise.</span>Brisk aerobic exercises like jogging help release brain chemicals that cutstress and
                        improve your mood.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get better sleep.</span>Sleep problems and anxiety disorder often go hand in hand. Make getting good rest a
                        priority. Follow a relaxing bedtime routine.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn to relax.</span>Stress management is an important part of your anxiety disorder treatment plan. Things like
                        meditation, or mindfulness, can help you unwind after a stressful day and may make your treatment work
                        better.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep a journal.</span>Writing down your thoughts before the day is down may help you relax so you’re not tossing
                        and turning with anxious thoughts all night.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manage your negative thoughts.</span>Thinking positive thoughts instead of worrisome ones can help reduce
                        anxiety. This can be challenging if you have certain types of anxiety, however. Cognitive behavioural therapy
                        can teach you how to redirect your thoughts.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get together with friends.</span>Whether it’s in person, on the phone, or the computer, social connections help
                        people thrive and stay healthy. People who have a close group of friends that support and chat with them
                        have lower levels of social anxiety.</li>
                    
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Seek support.</span>Some people find it helpful and uplifting to talk to others who are experiencing the same
                        symptoms and emotions. Many benefits can result from finding a therapist, counsellor, or other to help
                        at times. Take appointment today with your SAL therapist because your health and life are worth it.</li>
