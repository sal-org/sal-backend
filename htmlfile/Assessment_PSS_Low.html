            <div>
                <p>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) by Sheldon Cohen is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful. The assessment helps us to understand how different situations affect our feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask you about your feelings and thoughts during the last month.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Stress Management Tips</h4>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Re-balance Work and Home.</span> All work and no play? If you’re spending too much time at the office, intentionally put more dates in your calendar to enjoy time for fun, either alone or with others.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Build in Regular Exercise.</span> Moving your body on a regular basis balances the nervous system and increases blood circulation, helping to flush out stress hormones. Even a daily 20-minute walk makes a difference.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Eat Well and Limit Alcohol and Stimulants.</span>Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine may temporarily relieve stress but have negative health impacts and can make stress worse in the long run. Well-nourished bodies cope better, so start with a good breakfast, add more fruits and vegetables, avoid processed foods and sugar, and drink more water.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Connect with Supportive People.</span>Talking face to face with another person releases hormones that reduce stress. Lean on those good listeners in your life.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Carve out Hobby Time.</span>Do you enjoy gardening, reading, listening to music or some other creative pursuit? Engage in activities that bring you pleasure and joy; research shows that reduces stress by almost half and lowers your heart rate, too.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Practice Meditation, Stress Reduction or Yoga.</span>Relaxation techniques activate a state of restfulness that counterbalances your body’s fight-or-flight hormones. Consider joining mindfulness inducing exercise classes teaching Yoga, body balance, meditation, laughing clubs and many other courses to learn effective, lasting tools.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Get adequate Sleep.</span>If you sleep too little or too much, there might be psychosomatic issues. So 7-8 hours on an average are good for physical and emotional well-being.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Bond with Your Pet.</span>Clinical studies show that spending even a short time with a companion animal can cut anxiety levels almost in half.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">9. Take a Vacation.</span>Getting away from it all can reset your stress tolerance by increasing your mental and emotional outlook, which makes you a happier, more productive person upon return. Leave your cell phone and laptop at home.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">10. See a Counsellor, Coach or Therapist.</span>If negative thoughts overwhelm your ability to make positive changes, it’s time to seek professional help. Make an appointment today with your SAL therapist because your health and life are worth it.</p>
